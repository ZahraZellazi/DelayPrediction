🛫 Flight Delay Prediction for Tunisair Handling ✈️

🌸 Project Overview
Flight delays are a major challenge in the aviation industry, especially for ground operations like Tunisair Handling. This project uses Machine Learning to analyze historical flight data and predict delays — helping improve operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

We tackle this problem with three different predictive models:

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
1️⃣ Binary Classification
Goal: Will the flight be delayed?
🎯 Type: Yes / No
🔍 Model Examples: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
🎯 Use Case: Alert operations to potential delays in advance.

2️⃣ Regression
Goal: How many minutes will the flight be delayed?
🕒 Type: Numerical prediction (e.g., 25 minutes)
📈 Model Examples: Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor
⏱️ Use Case: Plan better resource allocation by predicting exact delay time.

3️⃣ Multiclass Classification
Goal: What is the reason for the delay?
📦 Type: Categorical output (e.g., Technical issue, Weather, Crew, ATC...)
📊 Model Examples: Decision Trees, Multinomial Logistic Regression
🛠️ Use Case: Identify root causes to reduce future delays and take preventive actions.

🧩 Data Used
We used operational data from Tunisair Handling, which includes:

📋 Flight schedules (STD/STA)

✈️ Aircraft types

⏰ Actual arrival/departure times

📍 Terminal & gate information

🛠️ Delay codes and reasons (from opscontrol_coderetard)

🧑‍✈️ Agent and corrective action history

🎯 Objectives
🔮 Anticipate Delays: Make proactive decisions

⚙️ Optimize Resources: Better use of gates, crew, and equipment

🧘 Improve Passenger Experience: Less waiting, more satisfaction

📉 Reduce Operational Costs: Fewer disruptions = lower costs

🪄 Tech Stack
🐍 Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)

📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

🧪 Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

💾 CSV/SQL files from Tunisair systems

🎨 Aesthetic Inspiration
This project is designed with a pastel theme 🌷 — gentle visuals and clean layouts that help you stay calm even when delays are not. Because data science can be beautiful too. 🧁✨

🚀 Next Steps
✅ Clean and preprocess the data

✅ Train/test ML models

🔄 Evaluate models with cross-validation

📈 Deploy or visualize results in Power BI or Streamlit

💡 Final Note
By predicting when, how long, and why delays occur, we can help Tunisair Handling soar toward a more efficient and passenger-friendly future.

“Because every minute on the ground is a minute lost in the sky.”
